[![Build Status](https://github.com/edsu/respec-action/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/edsu/respec-action/actions/workflows/main.yml)

*respec-action* is a [Github Action] for automatically publishing Markdown files as [ReSpec] HTML. The idea is that it is easier to edit and manage specifications in Markdown, but easier to read specifications in your browser using HTML. By using respec-action you can have every commit to your Markdown trigger a rebuild of your specifications.
